Fifa20 is a very popular game and played all over the world on various gaming platforms. 
When it comes to choosing similar players who would give you the same attritubes and skills, we often tend to get confused by selecting the most similar player because so many have so many similar attritubes. 
They might differ little bit on real life scale but on a gaming platforms only ratings decides a player's outcome. Sometimes, not everyone can afford to buy all the most rated player and also these most rated players are very few, so we might have to choose from the others available.

This player recommender system can be very helful in those scenario. It recommends you top 7 players(can vary based on parameter value). It uses K-NN algorithm to find the most nearest players based on his attributes. 

Many other analysis such as selecting top young prospects, best buys, positions vs overall rating of the player, ratio of players based on top countries and international ratings are also demonstrated.
