Fifa20 is a very popular game and played all over the world on various gaming platforms. 
When it comes to choosing similar players with respect to attritubes and skills, the video game players often tend to get confused in selecting the most similar player because of the many similar attritubes. 
The players might differ a bit in real life but on a gaming platforms only ratings decides a player's standings. Sometimes, not all video game players can afford to buy the top rated player and there are not too many rated players available in the dataset, so they might have to choose from the others available.

This player recommender system can be very helful in such scenario. It recommends the top 7 players(can vary based on parameter value). It uses K-NN algorithm to find the most nearest players based on his attributes. 

Many other analysis such as selecting top young prospects, best buys, positions vs overall rating of the player, ratio of players based on top countries and international ratings are also demonstrated.
